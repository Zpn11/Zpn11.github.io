Due to historical reasons such as colonization, its financial environment and cultural thinking are quite different from China's, so the company has formulated specialized policies to deal with different countries.

## Stakeholders

1. Special advantages

    With the increasing development of financial technology, the products of various companies are becoming increasingly homogeneous, and due to the high salaries of scientific and technological talents, the main cost of scientific and technological enterprises is labor cost. [1] For cost control, this company has used years of experience to create a management system to help coordinate the operations of various departments. This is specifically reflected in the work under the leadership of sales staff, so as to connect with customers and communicate face-to-face. Customer needs, and inform the R&D department of customer needs, so that products can reduce intermediate costs while meeting customer needs. Through the above management system, costs can be reduced and price advantages obtained among similar enterprises. [1] Chinese Government Network.

4. The cooperative attitude and operating model adopted within the business network

    The company's ability to maintain its dominant position depends more on how to communicate better with old customers and how to maintain them.

The company actually has a corporate culture with a kind of Jianghu atmosphere. The company will not abandon customers or suppliers, so In fact, the company has a good reputation in the entire upstream and downstream relationships. The company also treats its employees with a bit of a Jianghu atmosphere.

## Competitive advantage and disadvantage

The first is the policy advantage. As a pioneer in this industry, you will get political support from some countries. When the company started, our country's financial technology was very weak, but the financial industry is a vital lifeline for a country. . When enterprises first entered this industry, they tried to use their own strength to make up for the country's shortcomings and deficiencies in this area. After the company went public, it received technical and financial support from many countries. Then came the disadvantages of corporate development. Many imitators and competitors appeared in the country, causing the industry environment to gradually transform into involution. As a pioneer in the industry, the company is so large that it cannot change quickly when changing its development direction, and technological updates cannot quickly keep up with the development of the times.
