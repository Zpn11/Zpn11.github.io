      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Parties Involved:&#xA;Petitioner: Thomas Gibbons, a steamboat operator holding a federal license.&#xA;Respondent: Aaron Ogden, a steamboat operator with an exclusive state license granted by New York.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-background-of-the-dispute&#34;&gt;1. Background of the Dispute&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conflict in Gibbons v. Ogden arose from overlapping state and federal authority over interstate commerce. In 1808, New York granted Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton an exclusive license to operate steamboats in the state&amp;rsquo;s waterways for 30 years. Aaron Ogden later purchased this franchise, allowing him to solely navigate New York waters. Concurrently, Thomas Gibbons obtained a federal license authorized by an act of Congress to operate steamboats between New York and New Jersey. Ogden sued Gibbons in a New York state court, arguing that the federal license infringed upon New Yorkâ€™s exclusive rights to its waterways. Gibbons contended that his operations constituted interstate commerce, thereby falling under federal jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
